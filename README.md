### File describing the project

## Technologies used

* Postgres
* Postico
* Node.JS
* GraphQL

## Personal Learnings

This project has taught me the server-client model, I have understood how to connect a database (Postgres) with the server (node.js), And how to use a different interface like GraphQl to query information from the database through the server. 

Additional I have learnt how to use 'try' and catch, and I will more time to understand promises. However, this project has given me the basis to talk about it. 

## Personal struggles

* async functions 
* promises


## Future Development

I will create another project with similar characteristics to master every step that we have done with this project.
