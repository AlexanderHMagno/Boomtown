### File describing the project

## Technologies used

* Postgres
* Postico
* Node.JS
* GraphQL
* React 
* Apollo


## Most important technologies. 


[🏁 Final Form](https://github.com/final-form/final-form#-final-form)

🏁 React Final Form is a thin React wrapper for 🏁 Final Form, which is a subscriptions-based form state management library that uses the Observer pattern, so only the components that need updating are re-rendered as the form's state changes. By default, 🏁 React Final Form subscribes to all changes, but if you want to fine tune your form to optimized blazing-fast perfection, you may specify only the form state that you care about for rendering your gorgeous UI.

[Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)

React components for faster and easier web development. Build your own design system, or start with Material Design.


[GraphQl](https://www.graphql.com/)

All of the data you need,
in one request
GraphQL is an open spec for a flexible API layer. Put GraphQL over your existing backends to build products faster than ever before.

Do GraphQL Right (with [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/))
Replace many inflexible APIs with a single versatile query system.
Decouple frontend and backend development.
Ship high quality apps to more platforms faster.


[Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

Predictable

Redux helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client,server, and native), and are easy to test.

Centralized

Centralizing your application's state and logic enables powerful capabilities like undo/redo, state persistence, and much more.

[React](https://reactjs.org/)

Simple -> A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Declarative
React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.



## Personal Learnings

This project has taught me the server-client model, I have understood how to connect a database (Postgres) with the server (node.js), And how to use a different interface like GraphQl to query information from the database through the server. 

Additional I have learnt how to use 'try' and catch, and I will more time to understand promises. However, this project has given me the basis to talk about it. 

## Personal struggles

* async functions 
* promises


## Future Development

I will create another project with similar characteristics to master every step that we have done with this project.
